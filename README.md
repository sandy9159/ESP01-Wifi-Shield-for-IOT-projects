The ESP8266 ESP-01 is a Wi-Fi module that allows microcontrollers access to a Wi-Fi network. 

This module is a self-contained SOC (System On a Chip) that doesnâ€™t necessarily need a microcontroller to manipulate inputs and outputs as you would normally do with an Arduino, for example, because the ESP-01 acts as a small computer. Depending on the version of the ESP8266, 

it is possible to have up to 9 GPIOs (General Purpose Input Output). Thus, we can give a microcontroller internet access like the Wi-Fi shield does to the Arduino, or we can simply program the ESP8266 to not only have access to a Wi-Fi network, but to act as a microcontroller as well. 

This makes the ESP8266 very versatile, and it can save you some money and space in your projects.

The ESP-01 WiFi Module Shield provides a convenient connection between an Arduino and an ESP-01 module, which contains an ESP8266 microcontroller with WiFi support. 

The shield provides a 3.3V power supply for the module, and logic level converters so it can operate with either 3.3V or 5V Arduino boards.
